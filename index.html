                <h3>TFIDF</h3>
                <p>In this project, I built a Java-based search system for an online library using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to retrieve and rank relevant documents. The system included two interfaces—Text and Library—used to compare performance and analyze how different data structures affect search efficiency. I experimented with structures such as TreeMap, HashMap, and ArrayList to evaluate their impact on both runtime and memory usage across various tasks like indexing, term frequency counting, and ranking. The focus was on determining which data structure worked best under each interface in terms of time and space complexity. This project helped me explore the trade-offs between different Java collections and reinforced my skills in algorithmic optimization, file processing, and performance benchmarking in real-world search scenarios.</p>

                <h3>Humor Detection</h3>
                <p>This Natural Language Processing project focused on detecting humor in movie reviews using a large subset of the IMDb dataset. I implemented transformer-based models for classification, fine-tuning them for humor detection in text. Given the limited GPU resources, I explored zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques to maximize model performance without extensive training. This allowed me to evaluate how transformer models like BART or RoBERTa perform when generalizing to niche tasks. I preprocessed the data for tokenization and cleaning, and implemented evaluation metrics such as F1-score and accuracy. The project challenged me to work with real-world constraints and taught me how to manage large-scale NLP tasks efficiently, optimizing for both resource usage and accuracy. It also deepened my understanding of how modern language models interpret context and tone to identify something as subjective as humor.</p>

                <h3>Purrfect Match</h3>
                <p>Purrfect Match is a Flask-based web application that connects pet owners to arrange playdates, meetups, and community events for their pets. I designed it with features like user registration, pet profiles, real-time chat, and a search function to find compatible pets based on preferences. The goal was to build a fun, social platform where people can connect through their pets. The backend was built in Python using Flask, with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. I also integrated basic database functionality for storing user and pet data. This project combined my interest in web development with my love for animals and helped me learn how to design a full-stack web application. Adding real-time chat pushed me to understand asynchronous communication and socket programming concepts, making this one of my most complete and creative projects.</p>

                <h3>Pong</h3>
                <p>As a fun way to practice interactive programming, I built a version of the classic Pong game using Python's turtle module. The game features two paddles, a bouncing ball, and a scoring system. I designed the interface using turtle graphics and implemented game mechanics like collision detection, velocity adjustments, and paddle control with keyboard bindings. The game loops through a real-time update function, giving the feel of classic arcade gameplay. I also added boundary checks and dynamic difficulty by increasing ball speed as rallies continue. This project was both entertaining and educational—it helped me grasp core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, coordinate geometry, and real-time input handling. It was also a great way to appreciate how games are built from the ground up without external libraries.</p>

                <h3>Pomodoro</h3>
                <p>I recreated the classic Pomodoro technique in a standalone desktop application using Python and Tkinter. The app provides a simple interface that helps users focus on tasks using timed work intervals followed by short breaks. It includes a timer display, session tracking, start/stop/reset buttons, and a visual countdown bar. I focused on keeping the user experience intuitive while maintaining accuracy in the timer mechanism. Building this project allowed me to strengthen my understanding of Python GUI programming and event-driven development. It also gave me a chance to experiment with sound notifications, color cues, and time formatting to improve usability. The Pomodoro Timer not only helped me become more productive personally, but also gave me a hands-on way to apply object-oriented programming concepts in a useful tool.

                <h3>Astronomy Club Website</h3>
                <p>To support outreach and communication within the Astronomy Club, I developed a responsive website using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal was to notify members of upcoming stargazing events, meetings, and other activities while boosting awareness and engagement. The website includes a clean homepage, an events calendar, and a section for announcements and club photos. I used basic DOM manipulation and form elements to allow members to subscribe for email notifications or RSVP for events. The website was designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure accessibility on various devices. This project helped me reinforce front-end web development fundamentals and emphasized the importance of design for usability, clarity, and accessibility. It also served as a practical way to contribute to a community organization I’m actively involved in.</p>
